// NOTE: While consumers have access to these helpers they are still considered
// private API and subject to change without notice as the tests will continue
// to be refactored until we are satisifed with the quality of the tests and
// these helpers. When we are satisfied with these helpers we will document
// them, making them public API, at which point consumers will be free to use
// them without the worry of them changing on minor/patch upgrades.
